I will provide you with a list of column names from a `Records` database table named `USER_GROUP_USER_XREF`. 
Produce a description for each data element. 
Wrap each description in double quotes.
Return the results as a multi-line list, with each individual Description on a separate line of text.
For each line in your response, format the line as follows: <table name>,<column name>,<description>
Insert a "~" in between each line of text.
Here is the list of column names:
FUNC_LEVEL
USER_GROUP_ID
USER_ID
WGA_FLAG
