I will provide you with a list of column names from a `Records` database table named `USER_GROUP_USER_XREF`. 
For each column name, I need you to create a `Friendly Name` as follows:
The friendly name for each column name is to be a human readable set of one or more words, derived from the column name.
Each friendly name returned should have the first letter of each word in upper case and all other characters in lower case.
Search through the text of each element name and break it up into one or more words seperated by spaces.
Any substring within the element name that matches an English word should be considered one of the seperated words.
If an element name contains a substring that matches a well known English abbreivation, the full text of the abbreviated item should be considered one of the seperated words.
For example the element name HORSEDR should result in the following: Horse Doctor
Interpret the use of camel case or Pascal case within the element name as defining a word boundary.
For example the element name AssessingMissionCenterName would be separated into the following words: Assessing Mission Center Name
Interpret the `_` character within a column name as defining a word boundary.
For example ApprRequestForm_ID would be separated into the following words: Appr Request Form ID
Another example is Escort_ID would be separated into the following words: Escort ID
Another example is LOGEndDate would be separated into the following words: Log End Date
If the column name consists of a single word, return that word only.
For example a column name of "BUILDING" would result in the following: Building
Do not include the underscore character `_` in your response.
Do not include an escaped underscore character such as `\_` in your response.
In your response, return exactly one line of words for each column name.
For example, if the list of column names provided has 12 columns listed, your response must contain exactly 12 lines of text.
Return the results as a multi-line list, with each individual Friendly Name on a separate line of text.
For each line in your response, format the line as follows: <table name>,<column name>,<friendly name>
Insert a "~" in between each line of text.
Here is the list of column names:
FUNC_LEVEL
USER_GROUP_ID
USER_ID
WGA_FLAG
